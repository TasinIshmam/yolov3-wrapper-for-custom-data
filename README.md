## Simple YOLOv3 wrapper for custom data 

This repository is based on YOLOv3 implementation from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3)

Here we simply add all the required configuration files to quickly initiate training and inference. 

Specifically, all the configuration files are targeting dataset for [dhaka-ai](https://dhaka-ai.com/) competition.

More details training and inference is presented in this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1x2NZUVJtVqmeSFpBO_XNmv2esMrHPGQ7?usp=sharing)
